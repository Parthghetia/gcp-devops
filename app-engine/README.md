- Here is an example of App Engine in Action
- Let's take a look at services here:

- That will open the app in a new tab
- In App Engine you can also split traffic, basically you could be able to split traffic between different versions. Where let's say an older version is still running 50 percent of the traffic compared to a newer version to avoid outages due to newer changes

- App engine is also able to delegate tasks through Push Queues, Pull Queues and Cron Jobs as well
- By default App Engine offers a shared MemCache for use by your apps
- You can setup custom domains and SSL Certs in the settings section and also be able to setup Mail Servers to send emails through your app

## Hands On -> App Engine
- Deploying an App Engine Application
- We will enable the following APIs:
1. Cloud Datastore API

2. Cloud Build API

- We are then going to create a bucket (The why will come later)
